# Question: How can you merge overlapping intervals in a list? C# Summary

The C# program merges overlapping intervals in a list. It first defines an `Interval` class with `Start` and `End` properties. The `Merge` method is then defined to take a list of intervals as input. If the list contains one or no intervals, it returns the list as is. If the list contains more than one interval, it sorts the list in ascending order based on the `Start` property of the intervals. It then initializes a new list to store the result and a variable to keep track of the current interval. It iterates over the sorted list of intervals, and for each interval, it checks if the `Start` of the current interval is less than or equal to the `End` of the previous interval. If it is, it means the intervals overlap, and it merges them by setting the `End` of the previous interval to the maximum of the `End` of the current and previous intervals. If the intervals do not overlap, it adds the previous interval to the result list and updates the previous interval to the current one. After the iteration, it adds the last interval to the result list. The `Main` method creates a list of intervals, calls the `Merge` method to merge the intervals, and prints the merged intervals.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar approach to the C# version. Both versions first sort the intervals by their start times, then iterate over the sorted intervals, merging overlapping intervals and adding non-overlapping intervals to the result.

However, there are some differences due to the different features and syntax of the two languages:

1. Data Structure: In the C# version, intervals are represented as objects of a custom `Interval` class with `Start` and `End` properties. In the Python version, intervals are represented as lists of two elements. This is a simpler and more direct representation, but it doesn't provide the same level of abstraction and type safety as the C# version.

2. Sorting: Both versions sort the intervals by their start times, but they do it in different ways. The C# version uses the `OrderBy` method from LINQ and a lambda function to specify the sorting key. The Python version uses the built-in `sort` method and a lambda function as the key argument.

3. Looping: In the C# version, a for loop with an index is used to iterate over the intervals. In the Python version, a for-each loop is used, which is more idiomatic in Python and doesn't require dealing with indices.

4. List Manipulation: In the C# version, the `Add` method is used to add intervals to the result list. In the Python version, the `append` method is used for the same purpose. Also, the Python version uses the `[-1]` index to access the last element of the list, which is a feature not available in C#.

5. Function Definition: The C# version defines the `Merge` function as a static method inside the `Program` class, while the Python version defines `merge_intervals` as a standalone function. This is because Python supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, while C# is primarily an object-oriented language.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem in a similar way. They both define an `Interval` class (or struct in C#) with `start` and `end` properties. They both have a `merge` method that takes a list of intervals, sorts them by the `start` property, and merges overlapping intervals.

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used:

1. In C#, properties are used (`Start` and `End`), while in Java, fields are used (`start` and `end`). 

2. The C# version uses LINQ's `OrderBy` method to sort the intervals, while the Java version uses the `sort` method with a lambda expression.

3. The C# version uses a `List<Interval>` for the result, while the Java version uses a `LinkedList<Interval>`. 

4. The C# version uses a `for` loop with an index to iterate over the intervals, while the Java version uses a for-each loop.

5. The C# version uses the `Math.Max` method to get the maximum of two numbers, while the Java version uses the same method from the `Math` class.

6. The Java version takes input from the user for the intervals, while the C# version has the intervals hardcoded.

7. The C# version uses string interpolation to print the intervals, while the Java version concatenates the `start` and `end` values with a space.

8. The C# version uses the `Add` method to add an interval to the result list, while the Java version uses the `add` method.
